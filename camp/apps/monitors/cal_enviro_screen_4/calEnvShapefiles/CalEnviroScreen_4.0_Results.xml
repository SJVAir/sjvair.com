            <abstract>The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) 
announces the availability of a new version of the California 
Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool: CalEnviroScreen 4.0. 
CalEnviroScreen is a screening methodology that can be used to help 
identify California communities that are disproportionately burdened by 
multiple sources of pollution.The CalEnviroScreen 4.0 results are available as a mapping tool. Maps of the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 Indicators are also available.

	This version updates CalEnviroScreen in a variety of ways:

	All indicators contain the most recent available data.There are improvements in the way some indicators are calculated 
to better reflect environmental conditions or population vulnerability 
to pollution.One new indicator, Childrenâ€™s Lead Risk from Housing, accounts for possible lead exposure from paint and other sources in or around the home.</abstract>
