                    <h1>Testing and Installing PurpleAir Monitors</h1>

                    <p>Prior to deployment, all PurpleAir monitors are tested at Root Access in Fresno. Groups of 30-40 monitors are set-up on a rack on the roof of the building and operated until the ambient PM2.5 mass range exceeds 35 ug/m3. Data from the PurpleAir monitors is then analyzed to generate intra-device (A vs B sensor) and inter-device (monitor 1 vs monitor 2) correlations and variance. Monitors with intra- or inter-device correlations &lt; 0.98 or average percent variance &gt; 10% are retested and may be returned to the manufacturer.</p>

                    <p>Continuous PM2.5 beta attenuation monitors (BAM) are assembled and tested (leak test, flow calibration, zero calibration) at the school sites. BAMs are installed on a flat roof of a single-story building away from potential sources of PM (exhaust vents, HVAC units). BAMs are hardwired (ethernet) to a network and a Raspberry Pi microcontroller is used to access the BAM interface remotely. BAMs are maintained by SJVAir staff, including bi-monthly flow test, leak test, clean inlets, replace and/or grease O-rings and replace filter tape (tape may be replaced more frequently) with annual recalibration.</p>

                    <p>Real-time data from PurpleAir monitors is accessed through ThingSpeak APIs and stored in a cloud database (AWS). Python scripts have been developed to automatically assess intra-device sensor correlations (A vs B particle counts) for every new entry. Eighteen (18) PurpleAir monitors previously tested by the SJVAir team (as described above) are collocated with high performance PM2.5 BAMs operated by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (Air District), the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and SJVAir at locations across the SJV, as shown on the map below. Circles indicate 10-mile radius around collocation sites (blue are existing sites, red are planned sites).</p>

                    <h1>Calibrating and Displaying PurpleAir and BAM data</h1>

                    <p>Collocated PurpleAir and BAM data are used to generate correction equations (calibrations) by regressing hourly BAM PM2.5 concentrations with hourly average PurpleAir variables (0.3µm particle counts, 2.5µm particle counts, relative humidity, temperature). Regressions are run for varying time periods (past 24 hours, past 7 days, past 2 weeks, past month) to identify the strongest correlation (R2) and smallest standard error (SE). Python scripts allow calibrations to be updated daily and automatically applied to non-collocated PurpleAir monitor data based on proximity to each collocation site. Historical data from the collocated monitors is analyzed by staff each quarter to assess the accuracy of the automated calibrations. Staff are currently evaluating other potential calibration methods, including ML algorithms like Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting. The graph below compares corrected PM2.5 concentrations for the same collocated PurpleAir monitor in Madera, CA. The SJVAir conversion is based on correlation coefficients generated from local data that is more spatiotemporally applicable than fixed conversion factors available on the PurpleAir website (e.g. US EPA, Woodsmoke).</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Calibrated real-time data is displayed for all PurpleAir monitors (average concentration during previous 5 minutes). Near real-time is displayed for Air District and CARB BAMs (data (average hourly concentration during previous 80-139 minutes) and for SJVAir BAMs (average hourly concentration during previous 60-74 minutes). Trends for individual monitors are shown as a line graph for the past 72 hours (graph can be customized to display specific time periods).</p>

                    <p>SJVAir BAMs are installed at centrally located school sites, with PurpleAir monitors installed at surrounding schools. SJVAir coordinates with school district Facilities and IT directors to install and connect monitors. The map below shows network of BAMs in the SJV. The inset shows the SJVAir monitoring network installed in cooperation with Delano Union School District, including a centrally located BAM (with two collocated PurplAir monitors) at Cecil Ave Middle Schools used to calibrate PurpleAir monitors at ten (10) surrounding schools throughout the community of Delano.</p>
